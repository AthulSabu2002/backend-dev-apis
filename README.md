# Back End Development and APIs Certification Projects

This repository contains five microservice APIs built as part of the [freeCodeCamp.org Back End Development and APIs Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/). These projects demonstrate practical skills in Node.js, npm, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

## Projects

1. **Timestamp Microservice**
   - An API that returns Unix and UTC timestamps for a given date string or the current date.

2. **Request Header Parser Microservice**
   - An API that returns information about the client's IP address, language, and software from the request headers.

3. **URL Shortener Microservice**
   - An API that shortens URLs and redirects users to the original URL when the short link is visited.

4. **Exercise Tracker**
   - An API that allows users to create accounts, log exercises, and retrieve exercise logs. Built with MongoDB and Mongoose.

5. **File Metadata Microservice**
   - An API that accepts file uploads and returns metadata about the uploaded file, such as name, type, and size.

## Learning Outcomes

Through these projects, I learned how to:
- Build RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.
- Manage project dependencies with npm.
- Handle HTTP requests and responses.
- Parse and validate user input.
- Work with MongoDB and Mongoose for data storage and retrieval.
- Implement file upload functionality.
- Deploy and test microservices.

Each project is based on the official freeCodeCamp boilerplate and follows best practices for API development.
